# Welcome to the Flask App - My Notes!

This is an example application with a user login that can be used as a starting point for Flasking! This app is based on and inspired by the Flask tutorial by Miguel Grinberg's Flask Mega-Tutorial.
What is the difference? My Notes is very minimalistic in CSS style, content, and functionality. It contains user registration, login, and note creation forms. Just two DB tables (note and category) linked together with a foreign key is what you need to start with your prototype! No time to waste. Happy coding!
