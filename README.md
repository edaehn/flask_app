# Welcome to the Flask App - My Notes!

This is an example application with user login that can be used as a starting point
for Flasking! This app is based on and inspired by the Flask tutorial by Miguel Grinberg's
[Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world). 

What is the difference? My Notes is very minimalistic, in CSS style, content and functionality. 
It contains user registration, login and notes creation forms. 
With just two DB tables (note and category) linked together witha foreign key is what you 
need to start with your prototype! No time to waste, happy coding!
